Here’s a strong but respectful message that keeps it biblically accurate while making your point:

Hey [Name],

I respect your beliefs, but I’ve noticed something. You told me I should remove my Frank Ocean stickers, yet you wear crosses, which technically go against Exodus 20:4 (“You shall not make for yourself an image in the form of anything in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the waters below.”).

I find it interesting how certain things are called out while others are ignored. Romans 10:2-3 says, “For I can testify about them that they are zealous for God, but their zeal is not based on knowledge. Since they did not know the righteousness of God and sought to establish their own, they did not submit to God’s righteousness.” Meaning, sometimes people push religious rules so hard that they start making their own version of righteousness instead of following God’s.

I’m not saying you’re a bad person, but I do think you’ve taken this too far. If we’re going to talk about what’s biblically right or wrong, it has to go both ways—not just when it fits one person’s view. Nobody is perfect, and acting like we are doesn’t make us closer to God. Matthew 7:3 says it best: “Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother’s eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye?”

At the end of the day, my relationship with God is mine, just like yours is yours. Let’s not turn faith into a competition of who’s more righteous.

This keeps it direct, fair, and backed by scripture while making sure they understand your point. Let me know if you want to tweak anything.
