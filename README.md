The Crown of Self-Righteousness

There is a difference between faith and control, between righteousness and self-righteousness. The line is crossed when scripture stops being a guide for one’s own life and starts being a weapon against others. When a person believes that knowing a few verses gives them the right to dictate how others should live, they step into dangerous territory—one that scripture itself warns against.

	“For I can testify about them that they are zealous for God, but their zeal is not based on knowledge. Since they did not know the righteousness of God and sought to establish their own, they did not submit to God’s righteousness.”
— Romans 10:2-3

There is nothing wrong with having strong convictions. There is nothing wrong with wanting to live a life that honors God. But when those convictions turn into judgment, when they become an excuse to correct others while ignoring one’s own flaws, it stops being faith—it becomes self-glorification.

	“Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother’s eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye? How can you say to your brother, ‘Let me take the speck out of your eye,’ when all the time there is a plank in your own eye? You hypocrite, first take the plank out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother’s eye.”
— Matthew 7:3-5

It is easy to call out the so-called “flaws” in others while walking in contradiction. It is easy to condemn something as unholy while holding onto things that scripture itself warns against. The truth is, no one is without fault. No one is so righteous that they have earned the right to sit in the judge’s seat.

	“For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.”
— Romans 3:23

So before speaking with authority over another person’s life, before deciding what is “right” and “wrong” based on personal interpretation, take a step back. Ask: Is this truly about God, or is it about control? Because if righteousness does not come from God, then it is nothing more than pride disguised as holiness.
